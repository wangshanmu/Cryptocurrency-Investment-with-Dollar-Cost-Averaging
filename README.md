# Cryptocurrency-Investment-with-Dollar-Cost-Averaging
This repository is for CP3106: Indepedent Project at the National University of Singapore.

## 1. Crypto Data:
This folder includes the scripts to obtain the crypto-currencies data and generate temp file for further experimentations.

## 2. RL Environment:
This folder includes an OpenAI Gym style reinforcement learning environment for optimal stopping problem, and the instruction for registering this environment. 

## 3. Rainbow DQN:
This folder includes the scripts for traning and evaluating the rainbow DQN agent, and the investment visualization.

## 4. Presentation and Report:
This folder includes my presentation slides and final report for this project.
